TSSIM

==========================================================================
====== Turbidite System Simulation (TSSIM)=================
==========================================================================
==== This program aims to simulate the stacking patterns observed in  ====
==== distributary channel-lobe system using process-based statistics. ====
==== It uses surface-based simulation, grid deformation, and Object-  ====
==== based simulation. The README file                                ====
==== explains the inputs and outputs. Run 'tssim' without any arguments ==
==== to see an example with default input parameters. Uses functions   ===
==== from the Matlab Image Processing toolbox.                         ===
==== Parameters can be changed by editing tssim.m
